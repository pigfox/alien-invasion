# alien-invasion
Instructions
1. $ go run *.go

Assumptions
1. Not every city has a road to every other cities, dead ends do exist.
2. I created the data map given #1 in Findings section below.
3. Go maps are used for cities and aliens, the IDs for respective instances are the map indices.
4. The use of "-1" indicates that the integer value is not set.

Findings
1. The instructions were "You are given a map containing the names of cities in the non-existent world of X." There was no map provided so I created one with 10 cities. The very limited data set opens the possibility of many of unpredictable outcomes.

Sample Run
$ go run *.go
